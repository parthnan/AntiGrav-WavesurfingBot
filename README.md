# Anti Gravity + Wavesurfing Bot (used in Robocode tournaments)
Project to create a competitive Robot team of 3 Robots using Java in the software "Robocode"(https://robocode.sourceforge.io/) to fight in a 3 v 3 v 3 tournament. Each match was a 100 rounds with 3 bots from the above code, 3 bots from the opposing programmers, and 3 standard built-in bots known as "Walls.bot" . The team of bots coded above won the tournament of 14 teams decisively, with 13 victories and 0 losses.

# Summary of the bots
The bot uses two main strategies called AntiGravity(反重力) for unpredictable (and yet efficient) movement and Wavesurfing for fnding targets from opposing teams. The details for these two strategies and their implementation is explained thoroughly in the two files : PRESENTATION and DETAILREPORT (in Japanese, tournament held in Japan.).

# How to Use
1. Download the folder "group08" and the Robocode software from the site. Install Robocode.
2. Place the folder "group08" inside the folder "robocode/robots".  
3. Upon running Robocode, on the top left choose "Battle->New". Inside the list of packages choose "group08", and select "Team_group08_2018" to get a team of three OR select G08_Leader to get a single robot under "Robots".
4. Choose the opposing combatant robots similarly as in (3). 
5. Move to the Rules tab and editthe number of rounds, size of battlefield etc , and then start the battle.
